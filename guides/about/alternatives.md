# Alternative Solutions

_Part of the "About Jido" section in the documentation._

This guide compares Jido with alternative agent frameworks and solutions, helping developers understand where Jido fits in the ecosystem. It provides an honest assessment of when to use Jido versus other options, including both open-source and commercial alternatives.

This is a living document, and is not comprehensive. We are not _vouching_ for any of these packages, but rather listing them here for your convenience to investigate on your own.

## Agents

- [Agent](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Agent.html) - For simple agent systems, using the built-in Agent module may be sufficient.

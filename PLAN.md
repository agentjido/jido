Below is an extended TDD plan that focuses on fleshing out the IEx channel in more detail, including a simple Echo Agent and a full integration test. The goal is to demonstrate real-time, back-and-forth messages within an IEx-driven Chat Room.

1. Deepen the IExChannel Implementation

1.1 Add an Interactive Shell Process

Currently, the TDD plan for IExChannel described a straightforward approach: printing messages out to IO.puts and capturing user input. To go deeper:
	1.	Spawn a dedicated GenServer that:
	•	Maintains a small state with room_id, a reference to the room’s PID, and possibly a list of connected participants.
	•	Manages the IEx session loop.
	2.	Consider a Sub-shell or REPL Model:
	•	In advanced setups, you could create a sub-shell that “intercepts” user input. This can be done by:
	•	Using IEx.configure/1 or
	•	Spawning an IEx session in a separate node.
	•	For a simpler approach, you might provide a CLI prompt in the GenServer that reads user input from STDIN, sends it to the room, and prints responses.
	3.	:start_link/1 Implementation:
	•	Start a GenServer (IExChannel.Server) that loops:
	•	receive user input
	•	Dispatch to handle_incoming/2 or a “send to room” function.

File: lib/jido/chat/channels/iex_channel.ex

defmodule Jido.Chat.Channels.IExChannel do
  @behaviour Jido.Chat.Channel

  def start_link(opts) do
    # Start a GenServer that handles the interactive shell
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: Keyword.get(opts, :name, __MODULE__))
  end

  @impl true
  def send_message(room_id, sender_id, content, _opts) do
    # Delegate to the GenServer or directly handle printing to IEx
    IExChannel.Server.send_message(room_id, sender_id, content)
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_incoming(room_id, message) do
    IExChannel.Server.handle_incoming(room_id, message)
  end
end

File: lib/jido/chat/channels/iex_channel/server.ex

defmodule Jido.Chat.Channels.IExChannel.Server do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def init(opts) do
    # Possibly store a reference to the Room or Bus
    # Example: %{room_pid: opts[:room_pid], bus_name: opts[:bus_name]}
    {:ok, %{room_id: nil}}
  end

  # Example function invoked by the IExChannel public API
  def send_message(room_id, sender_id, content) do
    IO.puts "[IExChannel] => (#{sender_id} -> #{room_id}) #{content}"
    :ok
  end

  def handle_incoming(room_id, message) do
    IO.puts "[IExChannel] Incoming from user => (#{room_id}) #{inspect(message)}"
    :ok
  end
end

Why this approach?
	•	Having a dedicated Server module keeps the code more structured and testable.
	•	You can later enhance it to spawn an IEx sub-shell or a CLI loop.

1.2 Unit Tests for IExChannel
	•	File: test/jido/chat/channels/iex_channel_test.exs
	•	Test Outline:
	1.	test "can start_link the IEx channel"
	•	Check start_link/1 starts the GenServer and returns {:ok, pid}.
	2.	test "send_message prints to stdout"
	•	Use ExUnit.CaptureIO.capture_io/1 to ensure the correct text is printed.
	3.	test "handle_incoming prints or logs the message"
	•	Again, capture IO to verify it outputs the expected data.

TDD Flow
	1.	Write minimal failing tests that expect certain logs or output.
	2.	Implement just enough in IExChannel.Server to pass.
	3.	Refactor if needed to keep the code clean.

2. Introduce a Simple Echo Agent

A key integration test scenario is an “echo agent” that listens for chat messages and responds with an echo.
	•	This agent will help demonstrate a real-time conversation loop.

2.1 Create the Echo Agent
	•	Location: lib/jido/agent/examples/echo_agent.ex
	•	Action:
	•	Use the existing agent architecture (use Jido.Agent or similar).
	•	Subscribe to chat.message signals.
	•	On receiving a message from the Jido Bus, the agent responds by posting a message back to the same room, prefixed with “Echo: ” or something similar.

Example:

defmodule Jido.Agent.Examples.EchoAgent do
  use Jido.Agent

  @impl true
  def init(opts) do
    # e.g. subscribe to "chat.message" or "jido.chat.message.*" signals
    {:ok, opts}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_signal(%Signal{type: "jido.chat.message.text", data: data} = signal, state) do
    # Data might contain the room_id or you can fetch from signal.source
    content = data["content"]
    sender = signal.subject
    room_id = signal.source

    # Post an echo message back to the chat room
    # Possibly use Jido.Chat.Room.post_message/4
    Jido.Chat.Room.post_message(room_id, "EchoAgent", "Echo: #{content}", [])

    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_signal(_signal, state) do
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end

	•	Tests:
	•	File: test/jido/agent/examples/echo_agent_test.exs
	•	Write a small “unit-level” test verifying:
	•	If the EchoAgent receives a text message signal, it triggers the appropriate call to Room.post_message/4.
	•	Use a mock or stub for Room.post_message/4 if you want to isolate the agent logic.

3. Integration Test for IExChannel + Echo Agent + Chat Room

This is the crux: a high-level test that ensures the entire pipeline works. The scenario:
	1.	Start a bus (InMemory or PubSub, whichever you prefer for test).
	2.	Start a chat room using the IExChannel.
	3.	Spawn an Echo Agent that also connects to the same bus/room.
	4.	Simulate a user message from the IExChannel (like user typed “Hello!”).
	5.	Observe:
	•	The Chat Room persists the message on the bus.
	•	The Echo Agent sees the new message, posts “Echo: Hello!” back.
	•	The IExChannel sees the new agent message and prints to stdout.

3.1 Test Setup
	•	File: test/jido/chat/integration/iex_channel_integration_test.exs
	1.	setup block:
	•	Start or configure the Jido.Bus with the in-memory adapter for signals:

{:ok, _pid} = Jido.Bus.start_link(name: :test_bus, adapter: :in_memory)


	•	Start a chat room with the IExChannel:

room_opts = [bus_name: :test_bus, room_id: "test_room", channel: Jido.Chat.Channels.IExChannel]
{:ok, room_pid} = Jido.Chat.Room.start_link(room_opts)


	•	Start the Echo Agent:

{:ok, echo_pid} = Jido.Agent.Examples.EchoAgent.start_link(bus_name: :test_bus, ...)
# Possibly pass the "test_room" if agent logic needs it


	•	Return these pids in the test context.

3.2 Test Steps

test "IExChannel + EchoAgent integration test", %{room_pid: room_pid} do
  # 1. Simulate user sending a message from the channel
  # One approach: call IExChannel.Server.handle_incoming/2 
  message = %{sender_id: "User123", content: "Hello from IEx!"}
  Jido.Chat.Channels.IExChannel.Server.handle_incoming("test_room", message)

  # 2. Wait or use assert_receive to see if an "echo" message comes out from the channel or room
  # For instance, if the agent posted "Echo: Hello from IEx!", the bus should emit the new message
  # Possibly capture IO for the channel printing, or use a bus subscription to confirm the event

  # 3. We expect to see the echo message in the IExChannel output
  # Use ExUnit.CaptureIO to confirm "Echo: Hello from IEx!" is printed
  captured_output = 
    ExUnit.CaptureIO.capture_io(fn ->
      Jido.Chat.Channels.IExChannel.Server.handle_incoming("test_room", message)
      Process.sleep(100) # give some time for async messages
    end)

  assert captured_output =~ "Echo: Hello from IEx!"
end

	1.	Call handle_incoming/2 with the user’s message. This mimics a user typing in the IEx prompt.
	2.	The Room (via Jido.Bus) receives the new message, storing it in the stream.
	3.	The Echo Agent is subscribed to that message type and triggers Room.post_message/4 with “Echo: …”
	4.	The IExChannel sees the agent’s message (because the room calls send_message/4) and prints to STDOUT.
	5.	The test captures that output and asserts the presence of “Echo: Hello from IEx!”.

	Alternatively, you might do a fully “automated terminal input” approach, but that is usually more complex. The above approach calls the channel’s functions directly to simulate user behavior.

3.3 TDD Cycle
	1.	Write the integration test that outlines the entire flow. It likely fails at first because the channel doesn’t fully wire messages from handle_incoming/2 to the room or the agent.
	2.	Implement (or fix) the IExChannel to pass messages to the Room.post_message/4 method, or however your domain model expects it.
	3.	Iterate until the test sees the “Echo: Hello from IEx!” in the captured output.

4. Additional Considerations
	1.	Concurrency: Agents, Rooms, and Channels will be separate processes. Ensure your supervision tree is stable (failures in IExChannel.Server don’t crash the entire system).
	2.	Configuration: If you want each room to have a dedicated IExChannel process, pass the room_id and any needed references to the start_link/1 function.
	3.	Cleanup: In your integration test, ensure processes are shut down or use ExUnit on_exit to avoid lingering processes.

Final Summary of Extended TDD Strategy
	1.	Refine IExChannel into a more interactive GenServer (optional sub-shell).
	2.	Create an EchoAgent that responds to chat signals with an echo.
	3.	Write an end-to-end integration test:
	•	Start bus
	•	Start chat room with IExChannel
	•	Start Echo Agent
	•	Simulate user message => verify round-trip echo via channel output
	4.	Iterate until the integration test passes, ensuring your IEx-based workflow is robust, providing a realistic local environment to test chat interactions. This integration test strongly validates the entire pipeline—from channel input, through the bus, into an agent, and back out to the channel.

<Plan>
Below is a thorough architectural and design-level review of your Elixir Agent Server system, focusing on consistency, developer experience, and runtime flow. I have organized feedback by topic and specific modules/areas.

---

1. SIGNAL HANDLING & ROUTING

---

1.1 Consistency of Signal Emission Methods

- **Issue**: In several places (e.g., `ServerProcess`, `ServerRuntime`, `ServerState`), signals are directly instantiated with `Signal.new/1` or manually manipulated. Meanwhile, you have helper methods in `ServerSignal` (e.g., `ServerSignal.queue_overflow/0`, `ServerSignal.process_failed/0`, etc.) that produce canonical signal types.
- **Improvement**: Standardize on using the dedicated “signal builder” methods from `ServerSignal` or higher-level constructors. If a specialized method does not exist for a given signal scenario, define a new function in `ServerSignal` (e.g., `build_queue_overflow_event/2`) that returns a properly formatted signal. Avoid scattering `Signal.new(...)` calls throughout the code. This clarifies the domain and keeps signal creation uniform.

  1.2 `jido_output` vs. Channel-based Emission

- **Issue**: `emit_signal/3` merges dispatch configuration from both `signal.jido_output` and the server’s channel-based dispatch. While flexible, it can be confusing for new developers to trace how a signal ends up in certain channels.
- **Improvement**: Provide a more explicit naming convention or structured approach, e.g.:

  - If `signal.jido_output` is set, that is always used; otherwise fallback to the channel-based dispatch.
  - Or unify them with a single “dispatch pipeline,” so the user or developer always configures in one place.

  1.3 Overuse of Hard-coded String Type Matching

- **Issue**: The system uses many string-based type checks (e.g. `is_event_signal?/1` checks prefix `"jido.agent.event."`). This works but can get unwieldy if more event classes or domain signals are introduced.
- **Improvement**: Potentially replace prefix matching with a small classification function or enumerations. For instance, `SignalCategory` can handle whether a signal is a `:cmd`, `:directive`, `:event`, or `:log`. That function can map the prefix to an enum, making it easier to add new categories later.

2. AGENT SERVER (server.ex)

---

2.1 Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Handling

- **Observation**: The server handles synchronous signals via `handle_call/3` and asynchronous signals via `handle_cast/2` or `handle_info/2`. It’s a well-structured approach but can be confusing to trace if `GenServer.call` or `GenServer.cast` is used incorrectly by external callers.
- **Improvement**: Document in code the difference between the synchronous call path (`execute` -> returns immediate result) vs. the asynchronous cast path (`enqueue_and_execute`). Possibly rename your internal helper functions to clarify:
  - `handle_sync_signal/2` for calls
  - `handle_async_signal/2` for casts
- This helps reduce confusion about the flow of signals that get queued vs. those that get immediate responses.

  2.2 Flow from handle_call to ServerRuntime

- **Observation**: `handle_call({:signal, signal}, ..., state)` delegates to `ServerRuntime.execute/2` whereas the cast version calls `ServerRuntime.enqueue_and_execute/2`. This is logically correct.
- **Improvement**: Make sure the code that logs or tracks correlation IDs is consistent in both paths. If you set `signal.jido_correlation_id` in the synchronous path, do it in the asynchronous path too.

  2.3 Start-up and Initialization Sequence

- **Observation**: In `init/1`, a series of steps are done: building state, starting the child supervisor, building skills, merging routes, etc. Then you call `ServerCallback.mount/1` and attempt a state transition from `:initializing` to `:idle`.
- **Improvement**: If the code might fail in the middle of these steps, consider making them more atomic or handle partial failures. For instance, if building the router fails after the child supervisor has already started, it’s not entirely consistent. Think about whether you want an “all or nothing” initialization or if partial fallback is acceptable.
- **Developer Experience**: Log each step with debug statements or a higher-level “boot sequence” to help a future developer see the entire initialization story.

  2.4 Termination & Cleanup

- **Issue**: The `terminate/2` callback tries to perform an agent-level `shutdown/2`. If `shutdown` returns `{:ok, new_state}`, you proceed with `ServerProcess.stop_supervisor/1`. But if `shutdown` returns `{:error, reason}`, you do `{:error, reason}`. However, `GenServer.terminate/2` itself must always return `:ok` or end the process.
- **Improvement**: If `:error` is returned from your `shutdown` callback, you might want to log that error but still proceed with the rest of the cleanup. Otherwise, you risk leaving your system in a half-stopped state. A developer might not realize that a failure in the “shutdown callback” can block the entire termination. Consider always cleaning up the supervisor, even on an error.

  2.5 Code Duplication for State Checking

- **Issue**: Checking `ServerState.check_queue_size/1`, `ServerState.enqueue/2` etc. is repeated in handle_call/cast.
- **Improvement**: Potentially unify these in a single “server-internal helper” that enqueues or checks queue size, so you only do the logging or error emission in one place. This lowers duplication.

---

3. SERVER RUNTIME (server_runtime.ex)

---

3.1 Combining Steps in `enqueue_and_execute/2`

- **Observation**: This function enqueues a signal, then calls `process_signal_queue/1`. The loop in `process_signal_queue/1` tries to `dequeue` signals until empty or state `:auto`.
- **Potential Confusion**: If you have a large queue and `mode == :auto`, the entire queue is processed in one pass. If you have a developer that wants only one signal processed at a time, they need to override the mode or handle some step approach.
- **Improvement**: Consider renaming `process_signal_queue` to something like `drain_signal_queue` to clarify that it attempts to handle the entire queue in a single pass for `:auto`. Also, clarify in documentation that if the mode is `:step`, it will only process one item or partial queue.

  3.2 `execute_signal/2` Return Type

- **Issue**: `execute_signal` returns `{:ok, state, result} | {:error, reason}`. Then it calls `handle_cmd_result`, `handle_agent_step_result`, etc.
- **Improvement**: Evaluate whether you want to unify “result” vs “agent.result.” Sometimes the code merges them, sometimes it calls `on_after_run(..., agent.result, ...)`. Try to keep the final “execution result” in a single place to avoid confusion. For instance, do you store partial results in `agent.result` after each instruction or only store the final outcome?

  3.3 Large Try/Catch & Rescues

- **Issue**: The approach in `do_execute_all_instructions` uses a `try/rescue` block around runner calls. This is good for capturing exceptions, but can hamper debugging if you only log the string.
- **Improvement**: Provide more robust error info (stacktrace, etc.) or re-raise a specialized `Error.execution_error` with original details. Also, consider hooking into `on_error(agent, reason)` or `ServerOutput.emit_err` so the entire chain knows about the catastrophic failure.

---

4. SERVER DIRECTIVES (server_directive.ex)

---

4.1 Directive Execution vs. apply_server_directive

- **Observation**: Some directives in `Jido.Agent.Directive` are obviously for agent-level changes, while others are for server-level changes. Then in `Server.Directive.handle/2`, we handle only `Spawn` and `Kill`.
- **Confusion**: The `apply_server_directive` in `directive.ex` is partially used, but there is also a separate `ServerDirective.handle/2`. They do slightly different flows.
- **Improvement**:

  - Possibly unify how directives are “applied” to the server. If `spawn` or `kill` is recognized in `directive.ex`, unify with the server’s logic.
  - Or rename to “AgentDirective` vs. “ServerDirective” and keep them distinct in code. Right now, it’s easy for a developer to mix them up.

  4.2 Workflow for New Directives

- **Issue**: If a developer wants to add a new server-level directive (e.g., “PauseAllChildren”), they must define it in `Jido.Agent.Directive`, then handle it in `ServerDirective.execute/2` or in the agent.
- **Improvement**: Provide a “best practice” doc or clearer extension points. Possibly a behavior-based approach where new directive types live in their own modules, each implementing a “directive” behavior.

---

5. SERVERSTATE, PROCESS, CALLBACK

---

5.1 `ServerState` Finite State Machine

- **Observation**: You have `@transitions` with states like `:initializing -> :idle`, etc. This is a good approach for bounding valid transitions.
- **Improvement**:

  - Clarify in docstrings or code comments that `transition/2` does not handle event signals or side effects (like hooking into “on_exit”).
  - Expose a public function (like `transition!(state, desired)`) if you want a strict version that raises on invalid transitions— can help developer usage.
  - Or keep it the same but ensure logs or signals are consistently emitted upon success/failure of transitions (some transitions have logs, some do not).

  5.2 `ServerProcess` & DynamicSupervisor

- **Issue**: The code does a good job of starting and stopping child processes. However, if partial failures happen while starting multiple children, you manually collect “failures” in a list.
- **Improvement**: Decide if you want an “all-or-nothing” approach for multiple starts. If the user attempts to start `[spec1, spec2, spec3]` but `spec2` fails, do you keep `spec1` running or revert? The code currently does partial success. Document or handle that carefully.

  5.3 Lifecycle Hooks in `ServerCallback`

- **Issue**: `mount/1`, `shutdown/2`, etc. are included. If the agent implements its own `mount` or `shutdown`, the code calls them. But these are not consistently documented or used across the entire codebase.
- **Improvement**: Provide more usage examples or if you see that some standard method is not used widely, either remove it or better integrate it. For instance, if you want to rely more on `mount`, ensure all relevant code calls it at the right time.

---

6. AGENT EX (AGENT BEHAVIOR & DSL)

---

6.1 Overloaded Functions

- **Issue**: `Agent.set/3` can accept either an agent struct or a server pid, plus optional opts. This leads to branching inside the function. This pattern is repeated in `validate/2`, `plan/2`, `run/2`, etc.
- **Effect**: A developer might pass a “server pid” accidentally to the agent struct-based function or vice versa, causing confusion.
- **Improvement**: Consider splitting the interface:

  - `MyAgent.set_local(agent_struct, attrs, opts)` when dealing with a local agent struct in memory
  - `MyAgent.set_server(server_ref, attrs, opts)` when dealing with the running server
  - Or keep the same name but ensure the code is extremely well documented. This is a matter of developer experience.

  6.2 Dirty State vs. Pending Instructions

- **Observation**: The agent has a `dirty_state?` boolean plus a queue of `pending_instructions`. The code sets `dirty_state?` to true after merges.
- **Feedback**: This can cause confusion for a new developer. “Dirty” might overlap with the concept of queued instructions. Are we “dirty” if an instruction is queued but not validated?
- **Improvement**: Possibly remove `dirty_state?` or rename it to something more explicit like `pending_changes?`. Decide if this boolean is truly needed or if the presence of items in `pending_instructions` is enough.

  6.3 Single vs. Multiple Runners

- **Issue**: The agent references `runner` as a single module, but the server code can accept a custom runner via `opts[:runner]`.
- **Improvement**: This is fine, but clarify in the docs that the “configured runner” is overridden by the “runtime runner” if provided. Otherwise, new devs might be confused if they set `agent.runner = ChainRunner` but pass `runner: SimpleRunner`. Possibly rename the default to “default_runner” to highlight that it’s just a fallback.

---

7. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE & CONSISTENCY

---

7.1 Documentation & Callback Clarifications

- Provide more thorough docstrings for each callback in `Agent` and `Skill`, especially clarifying their typical usage, typical return types, and which are mandatory vs. optional.

  7.2 Avoid Over-Complicating the Language

- The code is quite verbose, which can be beneficial for clarity, but can also intimidate. Consider simpler naming in docstrings or reduce the repeated disclaimers.

  7.3 Smaller Files Where Possible

- Some modules contain large, complex logic (e.g. `server_runtime.ex` is fairly big). Breaking out sub-logic into smaller modules or subfolders (like `RuntimeQueue`, `RuntimeExecution`, etc.) can help new devs navigate the code more easily.

---

8. OVERALL THOUGHTS

---

- **Strengths**:

  - Using typed structs, clear docstrings, NimbleOptions-based validation, finite state machine approach for server states.
  - Good separation of concerns between agent vs. server.
  - The code reveals a strongly typed approach that will catch a lot of mistakes early.

- **Areas to Improve**:
  - Consolidate your signal creation and emission logic to rely on standardized helper functions.
  - Clarify synchronous vs. asynchronous flows with more explicit naming.
  - Improve partial-failure handling when starting multiple child processes or in the initialization steps.
  - Keep the directive system consistent between agent-level and server-level directives, or rename them to avoid confusion.
  - Revisit naming around `dirty_state?` and some of the repeated `apply_state` and `strict_validation` flags to keep them uniform or better explained.

Overall, the system’s concept is solid, but new developers might face friction with slightly overlapping concepts (like the difference between agent-level instructions and server-level directives, or the difference between the synchronous and asynchronous paths). Focusing on explicit naming, single entry points for signals, and clear “flow” documentation will go a long way to improving code readability and maintainability.
